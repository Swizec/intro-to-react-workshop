            If Nature had been comfortable, mankind would never have invented
            architecture...In a house, we all feel of the proper proportions.

        <p>It is always the unreadable that occurs.</p>
        <p>His style is chaos illumined by flashes of lightning.</p>
        <p>A reference to George Meredith's style.</p>

            would cease to be an artist.
