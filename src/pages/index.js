            Welcome to Swizec's Intro to React & Redux Workshop. Today you will
            build your first webapp with React and Friends. {`<Tomorrow>`} you
            will build a more complex app that uses Redux for state management.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your 1st day starts at the very beginning:{" "}
            <em>
                Why React? What problem does it solve? What makes it tick?
                What's the ecosystem like? Why are components the future?
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Your 2nd day starts with the idea that you magically remember
            everything and are now a pro. Don't worry if you're not, Swizec is
            here to help and he's going to code everything with you. If you get
            lost, sit back and observe. Checkout the example repo at key points
            so you can catch up.

        <p>By the end of the day you'll have built your first React app.</p>
        <p>Something like this ðŸ‘‡</p>

        <img src={Day1Example} />

        <p>
            A static list of tickets pulled from StubHub's API with some
            controls to change what you can see.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the end of the 2nd day, you'll have built something like thisðŸ‘‡
        </p>

        <video
            src={StubhubApp}
            controls
            autoPlay
            mute="true"
            loop
            style={{ width: "100%" }}
        />
        <p>
            A small StubHub app that lists event tickets from the StubHub API
            lets you add them to a shopping cart and "buy" them with a fake API
            call. It uses Redux to manage state, redux-form to manage forms, and
            React Router to help you hop around.

            This is an interactive workshop. If you have a question, <b>ask</b>.
            If something doesn't make sense, <b>ask</b>. If something is
            confusing, <b>ask</b>. If I'm not making sense, <b>ask</b>. If your
            code doesn't work, <b>ask</b>.
        </p>
        <p>You will write code today. The code will live on your computer.</p>
        <p>We will take breaks.</p>
        <h2>But first ask yourself this: Why are you here?</h2>
        <p>
            Answering that question will help you get the most out of this
            workshop.
        </p>
        <p>
            Code you'll write today works with <b>React 16</b> and uses modern{" "}
            <b>ES6+</b>. We'll assume a development environment created with{" "}
            <code>create-react-app</code>. This gives us some special powers. I
            will point them out.
